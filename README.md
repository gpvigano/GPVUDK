# GPVUDK
### GPV's Unity Development Kit
**Requires Unity 2018.1 or higher.**

This project collects some utility scripts and assets I developed to be reused in Unity projects.
Here are listed some functionalities grouped by topic.
* **Data**: object information, XML serialization
* **Motion**: behaviors for frame by frame transformation update (procedural movements, billboard, camera control, drag&drop, object following)
* **Scene**: Scene loading with UI management.
* **UI**: user interface utility (measure tool, multi-widget switch, slider text updater)
* **Util**: generic utility (application configuration, mathematics)
* **Visualization**: visualization utility scripts (line rendering, object switching, material replacement)

Also a collection of icons for the UI and some examples scenes are provided.

You can find some other experimental features in the [WIP](https://github.com/gpvigano/GPVUDK/tree/WIP) branch, but examples and complete documentation are still missing and it is not tested with the recent versions of Unity.
