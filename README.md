# GPVUDK
### GPV's Unity Development Kit
**Requires Unity 2017.1 or higher.**

This project collects some utility scripts and assets I developed to be reused in Unity projects.

**This is a work-in-progress.**

### Acknowledgements:
The World Space UI Interaction (WSUI) and the GameObjectFollower script were inspired by [VRTK](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK).

The gaze cursor was inspired by [MRTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).

Sound effects are from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

DieselSmoke particle effect is derived from [this tutorial](http://www.xenosmashgames.com/creating-smoke-with-shuriken-particle-system-in-unity3d/).
